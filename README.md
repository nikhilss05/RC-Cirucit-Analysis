# RC-Cirucit-Analysis
This is a trained machine learning model that we can us to predict the frequency of a given simple RC circuit considering the tolerance factors as well.

I have then deployed this model using stremlit.

This is an exemplary example of how machine learning can be employed in the field of circuit design
